Let us prove that \textit{TWICE\_SAT} is NP-complete by reducing 3SAT to it.
Given a 3CNF formula $\phi$ with $k$ variables, we create the formula $\phi' := \phi\ and\ (x_{(k+1)}\ or \ not\ (x_{(k+1)})$.
Clearly, if $\phi$ has at least one satisfying assignment, $\phi'$ must have at least two satisfying assignment, one where $x_{(k+1)}$ is true and one where it is false.
Therefore, \textit{TWICE\_SAT} can be reduced to 3SAT, which means \textit{TWICE\_SAT} is NP-complete.
