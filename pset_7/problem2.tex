% YOUR SOLUTION TO PROBLEM 2 GOES HERE
% THE LATEX CODE YOU PUT HERE WILL BE INLINED (IF YOU NEED ADD ANY PACKAGES DO IT IN THE MAIN TEMPLATE FILE)
Let us define our algorithm this way :\\\\
loop for each variable $x$:\

remove all clauses containing variables that only appear once	\\

remove all clauses containing literals that appear twice (in the entire formula)\\

remove all clauses containing variables that appear twice in the clause\\

find clauses $c_1$ and $c_2$ such that $c_1 = X\ OR\ Y and c_2 =\ not(x)\ OR\ Z$ for some $Y,Z$ (clauses)\\

if $c_1$ and $c_2$ exist, remove $c_1$ and $c_2$, add $c_3 :=\ Y\ OR\ Z$\\

if any clause is empty and the loop isn't finished, the formula is not satisfiable.\\

if the loop finishes, the formula is satisfiable.
