Let L be a language in P.
Let A be a polynomial-time algorithm that decides L.
We want to create $A'$, a polynomial type algorithm that decides $L^*$, given an input w consisting of characters $c_1c_2...c_n$.\\
To do so, using dynamic programming, we build a matrix M such that $M[i,j]$ is true iff $c_i...c_j \in L^*$. 
This matrix is built with a bottom-up approach, where $M[i,j]$ can be true if $c_i...c_j \in L$, or if $c_i...c_j$ can be divided in segments $s \in L\ \forall\ s$ (and therefore $c_i...c_j \in L^*$). \\
The process of building that matrix is done in polynomial time, more precisely in $O(a^3)$ where $a$ is the complexity of A since, for each pair $(i,j) \in (1..n, 1..n)$, there is one execution of A to check if $c_i...c_j\in L$ and $(j - i)$ executions of A to check if $c_i...c_j$ is made up of two parts $p \in L\ \forall\ p$. \\
Once this matrix is built, $w \in L^*\ iff\ M[1,n]$ is true.
