1) First let's convert the DFA to an NDA A', which is A with all state transitions reversed. \\

2) Convert A' to a DFA A'' (using techniques we saw in class) \\

3) Compare A and A'' (using the technique we saw in class, section 2.3 of lecture notes 5) \\

4) If they accept the same entries, accept, else reject.
