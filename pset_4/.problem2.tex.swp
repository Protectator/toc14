Let's take the Turing-Machine recognizing C. And modify it to stop after x, not reading the rest of the input. As the language can recognize and decide C, it can decide a substring of C, as there is no loop. Therefore R is Turing-Recognizable.

As a decidable language is a subset of a recognizable language, if we can decide on a substring of an input of C, we can decide the substring.
