Let us assume that R is recognizable. Then we could build a Turing machine for $A_{TM}$ in the following way :

1) For a word w, run 0w and 1w through R

2) If 0w is accepted, w is in $A_{TM}$

3) If 1w is accepted, w is not in $A_{TM}$

4) If 0w is rejected, w is in $A_{TM}$

5) If 1w is rejected, w is in $A_{TM}$

6) 0w and 1w cannot both cause halting, because either w is in $A_{TM}$ (thus, by the definition of recognizability, R must accept 0w, and may reject or halt on 1w), or w is not in $A_{TM}$ (thus R must accept 1w, and may reject or halt on 0w).

Therefore $A_{TM}$ is decidable. Since we know that $A_{TM}$ is not decidable, our assumption is wrong and R is not recognizable.
