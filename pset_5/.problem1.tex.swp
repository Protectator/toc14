Two languages intersect if their symmetric difference is not equal to their union. That is, there is a word in one language that will be removed when computing the difference with the other. Therefore, let us do the following :

a) Construct the DFA $M_{diff}$ out of the DFAs $M_1$ and $M_2$ (symmetric difference)

b) Construct the DFA $M_{union}$ out of the DFAs $M_1$ and $M_2$ (union)

c) Check if they are equal (as seen in lecture 5)

d) Reject if they are, otherwise accept.

This algorithm can easily be implemented using a Turin Machin and will never halt, therefore $INT_{TM}$ is decidable.
